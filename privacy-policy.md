## 1. Information We Collect

### 1.1 Account Information
When you create an account, we collect:
- **Name** – to personalize your experience
- **Email address** – for account identification and communication
- **Password** – stored in encrypted form; we do not store your plain-text password
- **Native language** – to improve translations and reading features

### 1.2 Content You Provide
- **Uploaded PDFs / books** – stored so you can read and sync across devices
- **Reading progress** – last page and total pages per book
- **Highlights and notes** – text you highlight and notes you create
- **Chat messages** – conversations with the in-app AI assistant (DuoRead Agent)
- **Vocabulary / word bank** – words you save for review

### 1.3 Device and Usage Information
- **Device type and OS** – to ensure compatibility and fix issues
- **Push notification token** – so we can send you reminders (e.g., reading reminders) if you enable them
- **App usage** – e.g., reading session duration and pages read, to power features like analytics and goals (only when you use those features)

### 1.4 Information Stored on Your Device
The app stores the following locally on your device (e.g., in secure storage):
- **Access and refresh tokens** – to keep you logged in
- **Theme preference** – light/dark mode
- **Cached PDF data** – so books load faster; you can clear app data to remove it

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to:
- **Provide the service** – e.g., sync your books, progress, highlights, and notes
- **Run AI features** – translation, summarization, definitions, and the DuoRead Agent chat (see Section 5)
- **Send push notifications** – only if you opt in (e.g., reading reminders, vocabulary review)
- **Improve the app** – e.g., fix bugs and improve performance
- **Respect your choices** – e.g., language and notification preferences

We do not sell your personal information to third parties.

---

## 3. Data Storage and Security

- Your account and content are stored on secure servers.
- Passwords are hashed; we do not have access to your actual password.
- Tokens and sensitive data on your device are stored using the platform’s secure storage (e.g., Android Keystore / secure storage).
- We use industry-standard practices to protect your data; no system is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

---

## 4. Data Sharing and Third Parties

We may share or use data only as follows:

- **Service providers** – We use third-party services to run the app (e.g., cloud hosting, AI for chat/translation). These providers process data on our behalf under strict agreements.
- **Legal requirements** – We may disclose information if required by law or to protect our rights, safety, or the rights and safety of others.
- **With your consent** – We may share data in other ways if we clearly ask and you agree.

We do not sell or rent your personal information.

---

## 5. AI and Third-Party AI Services

- Features such as **translation**, **summarization**, **definitions**, **synonyms**, and the **DuoRead Agent (chat)** are powered by AI.
- To provide these features, we send relevant text (e.g., selected text, your messages, and optional book context) to our AI service provider(s). This may include providers such as OpenAI. Their use of data is governed by their respective privacy policies.
- We do not use your content to train general-purpose AI models; it is used only to answer your requests within the app.

---

## 6. Push Notifications (Firebase)

- If you enable notifications, we use **Firebase Cloud Messaging** to deliver them (e.g., reading reminders, vocabulary review).
- This involves a push token and device identifiers as needed for delivery. Firebase’s practices are described in Google’s Privacy Policy and Firebase documentation.

---

## 7. Your Rights and Choices

You can:
- **Access and update** your profile (name, language) in the app.
- **Disable push notifications** in your device or app settings.
- **Delete your account** – contact us to request account and associated data deletion, subject to legal retention requirements.
- **Clear local data** – uninstalling the app or clearing app data removes locally stored data (e.g., cached PDFs, tokens).

DuoRead is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have collected such information, please contact us and we will delete it.

## 9. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of material changes by posting the updated policy (e.g., on this page or in the app) and updating the "Last updated" date. Your continued use of DuoRead after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
